                Hello! My name is Evard Mabounda and I am from Republic of Congo, Pointe-Noire. I
                enjoy
                hiking and exploring new horizons whenever I have time. I became quite adventurous
                because I realized life is too short to wonder what tomorrow looks like,
                Whenever there is an opportunity to learn and grow, I absolutely jump on it. The
                fear of
                the unknown has governed over my life until I decided now to challenge myself on
                doing
                hard things. I rely on God for everything because He is the one who provides the
                breath
                of life.
            </p>
