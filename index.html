            Hello! My name is Evard Mabounda and I am from Republic of Congo, Pointe-Noire. I enjoy
            hiking and exploring new horizons whenever I have time. I became quite adventurous
            because I realized life is too short to wonder what tomorrow looks like,
            Whenever there is an opportunity to learn and grow, I absolutely jump on it. The fear of
            the unknown has governed over my life until I decided now to challenge myself on doing
            hard things. I rely on God for everything because He is the one who provides the breath
            of life.
